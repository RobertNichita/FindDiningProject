Compliation of how to use **packages** that are used in Angular, and rules set for the project.

## Session Storage

To save current logged in user information in the browser. Closing the tab clears the storage.

We'll be keeping track of 3 pieces of information:

1. role
2. restaurantId (if applicable)
3. userId (email)

To set the values:

```typescript
sessionStorage.setItem('role', {{ the role}});
sessionStorage.setItem('restaurantId', {{ the restaurant id}});
sessionStorage.setItem('userId', {{ the user id / email}});
```

To get the values (can store into a variable):

```typescript
sessionStorage.getItem("role");
sessionStorage.getItem("restaurantId");
sessionStorage.getItem("userId");
```

We will be using this process to track a users role, their user id/email, and which restaurant they are associated with (if applicable).

### Query Parameters

To pass values through the URL as query. Have your variable passed as query parameters from wherever they clicked in from.

From the page they clicked in from (assuming the query params has been set to variables):

```html
<button (click)="function()"></button>
```

```typescript
function() {
  this.router.navigate(['/route_url'], {
    queryParams: { role: this.role, restaurantId: this.restaurantId },
  });
}
```

In the `.ts` file to recieve and set the variables:

```typescript
ngOnInit(): void {
  this.role = this.route.snapshot.queryParams.role;
  this.restaurantId = this.route.snapshot.queryParams.restaurantId;
}
```

`this.route.snapshot.queryParams.var` returns the query parameters set. You can now use those variables in your file.

## Image Upload Process

Instructions on how to implement image upload in the frontend side.

Ensure that you have these pieces of code in the `.ts` file of your component

```typescript
import { FormBuilder, FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';
...

uploadForm: FormGroup;
newImage: boolean = false;
...

constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder) {}

ngOnInit(): void {
  this.uploadForm = this.formBuilder.group({
    file: [''],
  });
}
...

onFileSelect(event) {
  if (event.target.files.length > 0) {
    this.newImage = true;
    const file = event.target.files[0];
    this.uploadForm.get('file').setValue(file);
  }
}

onSubmit() {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', this.uploadForm.get('file').value);
  this.restaurantsService
    .{{ uploadFunction }}(formData, {{ requiredId }}, {{ type? }} )
    .subscribe((data) => {});
  this.newImage = false;
}
```

| Purpose                                          | Upload Function       | Required Id  | Type               | Location              |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------- | :----------------- | :-------------------- |
| Change restaurant cover, logo, and owner picture | uploadRestaurantMedia | restaurantId | cover, logo, owner | restaurant.service.ts |
| Change dish image                                | uploadFoodMedia       | dish id      | N/A                | restaurant.service.ts |
| Change user image                                | uploadUserMedia       | user email   | N/A                | login.service.ts      |

In the `.html` file, the upload should be in a form (either on its own on encapsulated by a larger form).

```html
<form [formGroup]="uploadForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
  ...

  <label for="img">Add {{ img }} image:</label>
  <input type="file" name="img" id="img" (change)="onFileSelect($event)" />
  ...

  <a class="btn save-next" type="submit" (click)="onSubmit()">SAVE</a>
</form>
```

**NOTE:** Some manipluation may be needed. You can only add an image AFTER you have the repective id for it (i.e if you're making a new object, it must be created first to get the id)

## Style Guide

### Default Colours

Some of the default site colours are defined in the global `.scss` file.

To use the colours in your page/component, add this to the top of you `.scss` file

```css
@import "src/styles";
```

Then call on the colour using `$`:

```css
.navbar {
  background-color: $primary-color;
}
```

### Bottom Corner Image

Most pages will have an image at the bottom left corner to spice up the appearance of the page. Simply add the image to the page `.html` file and add the `bottom-left` class to it to format properly.

```html
<img class="bottom-left" src="assets/images/undraw_chef.png" />
```

The `bottom-left` class has been defined in `styles.scss`.
