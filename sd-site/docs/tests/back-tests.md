## Testing

Documented test cases can be found in server/{app}/test**.py where app is the corresponding app to test case.  

Specific apps, test suites, or even individual test cases can be run using the format: "python manage.py test App.Test_File.Test_Suite.Test_Case" depending on how deep you want to go. (Test_File is usually=tests)
